# Single Page Chatting Application Website

The Single Page function is meant to be implemented with Ajax? I'm about to do tutorials on that.
The way the login function works is that it only accepts the username input.
The database that stores all the information (detailed in the Proposal) is MySQL.
The functionalities of the website should be implemented with JavaScript.
